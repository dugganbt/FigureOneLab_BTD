# FigureOneLab_BTD
In this repository, I perform a bioinformatic case study following the [Figure One Lab guide by Dean Lee](https://www.linkedin.com/newsletters/figure-one-lab-7215418478743166979/). 

**__Disclaimer__**: This repository is an exercise in performing a bioinformatic analysis and is not intended as a reference. Please refer to the listed publications for peer-reviewed literature. 

## Background
This project follows a guided bioinformatic analysis based on public data and the Figure One Lab guide by Dean Lee. The project addresses the use of antibody two antibody therapies:
1. Trastuzumab for the treatment of HER2-positive breast and gastric cancers, targets HER2
2. Bevacizumab for the treatment of colorectal, lung, glioblastoma, breast, liver, and kidney cancer, targets VEGF.
