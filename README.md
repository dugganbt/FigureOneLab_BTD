# FigureOneLab_BTD
 A bioinformatic analysis case study, following the Figure One Lab guide by Dean Lee. 

## Background
This project follows a guided bioinformatic analysis based on public data and the Figure One Lab guide by Dean Lee. The project addresses the use of antibody two antibody therapies:
1. Trastuzumab for treatment of HER2-positive breast and gastric cancers, targets HER2
2. Bevacizumab for treatment of colorectal, lung, glioblastoma, breast, liver and kidney cancer, targets VEGF.

## Breaking down the Key Scientific Question (KSQ)
KSQ from the case-study: "Using available scRNA-seq data from cancer cell lines, how would you explore the use of the following FDA-approved antibody therapies in additional cancers?" 

To paraphrase: we want to evaluate the potential use of Trastuzumab and Bevacizumab for additional cancer treatments beyond their approved regimens using publicly available scRNA-seq data from cell lines.

### Subcomponent 1. Methodology used: How is scRNA-seq data used to assess cancer therapy? Advantages and limitations?

### Subcomponent 2. Model used: What aspects of the diseases do the cell lines recapitulate, and what limitations do they bring? What further studies would need to support this data?

### Subcomponent 3. Drugs and targets: What are the mechanisms of action for the conventional use-cases of the drugs, and how could this be expanded to additional cancers?
